## Architecture

We use [PowerSync](https://docs.powersync.co/integration-guides/supabase-+-powersync) to provide an offline-first experience for our [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/architecture) backend. This allows us to support users with a poor internet connection and make Little Help Book accessible to everyone.
